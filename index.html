                Hello! My name is COLLIN CHUANG and I am currently a second-year student at the 
                University of California, Merced. I am pursuing my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering, B.S. while also actively looking for experience opportunities whether it be internships, externships, or research. My journey with Software Engineering and coding started in 2021 when I took my first CS class during my first semester as an undergraduate student. Now it is a part of my identity and something I have grown a huge passion for. I plan to grow much more and create meaningful connections in the industry as I progress in my career.
